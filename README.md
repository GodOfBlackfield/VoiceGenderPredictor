# Voice Gender Predictor
This is a primary Machine Learning Project that detects a user's voice with a .wav recording and spectral analysis of the recording with a RandomForestClassifier model.<br>
To use your voice for testing, use a .wav recording and mention it in the path of the audio_test.py file. And run the file. Voila!
